INSTALLATION
To install, run `sudo make install-x` (or `su -c "make install-x"` if you do not
use sudo), replacing 'install-x' with one of the following:
- install-stumble
  Just install the stumble command line interface.
- install-kstumble
  Install the stumble command line interface, and the kstumble shell script. I
  don't see why this option would be used, but it's there if you need it.
- install-kde
  Install the stumble command line interface, the kstumble shell script, and the
  Konqueror service menu. This is the recommended option.
- install-kde4
  Install the stumble command line interface, the kstumble shell script, and the
  Konqueror service menu for KDE4. Please refer to the section below titled
  'KDE4 SUPPORT'.

REMOVAL
To uninstall, run the same commands as above, except replacing 'install' with
'uninstall'

KDE4 SUPPORT
KDE4 support is not perfect at the moment - there may be some bugs in the
interface (no submenu title, perhaps others), but all the basic functionality
seems to work the same. The Makefile assumes KDE4 is installed to /usr/lib/kde4,
as is the case in Ubuntu Gutsy at the moment (and perhaps some other
distributions as well). If this is not the case for your system, please find the
line 'KDE4PREFIX=/usr/lib/kde4' and update it to the correct path.
