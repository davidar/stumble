To install, run `sudo make install-x` (or `su -c "make install-x"` if you do not
use sudo), replacing 'install-x' with one of the following:
- install-stumble
  Just install the stumble command line interface.
- install-kstumble
  Install the stumble command line interface, and the kstumble shell script. I
  don't see why this option would be used, but it's there if you need it.
- install-kde
  Install the stumble command line interface, the kstumble shell script, and the
  Konqueror service menu. This is the recommended option.

To uninstall, run the same commands as above, except replacing 'install' with
'uninstall'
